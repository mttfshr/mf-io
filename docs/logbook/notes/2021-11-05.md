# Me-first storage

would look like:

- Studio/Workbench/Desktop area (piles)
  - Sketchbook (logbook)
    - pins
    - unassigned/not sure saves
    - updates
  - Projects (grouped)
    - plans
    - experiments
    - saves
    - activity layouts
- Presentation/Gallery/Artifacts area
  - Projects (grouped)
    - composed layouts per project
    - presentation-ready files
    - mixed file types in each project (media + .md + pdf etc)

Items from Sketchbook/Project can migrate to Presentation/Project

Views for Studio are like:

- tumblog
- slides
- feed

Views for Presentation are like:

- gallery
- page
- slides

# Thinking on types from yesterday

1. Activity docs
2. Artifact/Result/Outcome

Could really think of these as storage buckets instead, since items won't change from activity to artifact.

Unhooking storage location from presentation/layout... it shouldn't really matter where a thing is kept, right?

Could dump into two major locations based on how they function semantically (IRL for me in studio, not so much about data typing) and then use query rather than typing to differentiate in presentation.

With that in mind .. the list again under activity subtypes

- plans/recipes/layout instructions
- probes/trials/experiments
- log
- notes
- pins
- updates
- mentions

You might want something like \*.bookmark.md or \*.goto.md and \*.mention.md or something but everything (else) could be a Post type organized however it seems to fit. ie log, plans and notes in same folder/location shouldn't be an issue

Then for artifact types

- results/saves/snapshots/states
- archives
- presentations/shows
- layouts
- writings

There are going to be different presentation ideas, but what about the typing?

All of these

- archives
- presentations/shows
- layouts
- writings

are composed .md documents

These

- results/saves/snapshots/states

you'd ideally post images/media/files and be done but/and/or also be able to put them into some kind of formatted display like a gallery view
