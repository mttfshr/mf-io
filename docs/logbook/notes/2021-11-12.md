# Types and taxons

What seem like the different types/subtypes?

Logbook

    - pin (image, file, bookmark, repost, ie file/path)
    - note (todo, plan, post, ie text)

Profile

    - pages for bio, cv etc (md)

Projects

    - composed layouts
    - slide presentations

What kinds of tagging?

    - project
    - pub status
    - section
    - tag
    - layout/template?

What kinds of meta

Pin

    - href/path

Note

    - cover image?

Scripts

    - would be nice to not have to write a title: in meta. Pull first # h1 if no title
