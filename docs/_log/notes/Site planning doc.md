## Contents structure

### Idea 1: Separating draft work from final presentation
1. Studio/Workbench/Desktop area (piles)
2. Presentation/Gallery/Artifacts area
3. Bio/Profile 

Studio/Workbench/Desktop area (piles)

- Sketchbook (logbook)
  - pins
  - unassigned/not sure saves
  - updates
- Projects (grouped)
  - plans
  - experiments
  - saves
  - activity layouts

Presentation/Gallery/Artifacts area

- Projects (grouped)
  - composed layouts per project
  - presentation-ready files
  - mixed file types in each project (media + .md + pdf etc)

Bio/Profile

 - CV
 - Bio

### Idea 2: Grouping by template type
1. Logbook area
2. Projects area
3. Bio pages

Logbook

- notes (ie pages that get revised) 
- updates (posts that don't/blog)
- pins (bookmarks)

Projects

- Inside project, custom layouts and organization depending on project
	- this is probably more work but gives better result

## Views

- blog/tumblog
- slides
- paged
- gallery

## Organization & presentation ideas

- Revision history over chronology (ie no dated blog layout)
- Image, post and media organization in the content folder should be intelligible
- Contents of rendered public folder are also sharable via other protocols like dat or torrent
- Selective publish/syndicate per item to P2P or Federated social layer
