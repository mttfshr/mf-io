## Hi

- This is sort of a combination blog, sketchbook and lab. I have another site for [my cv and studio archive](http://www.mattfisherstudio.com). This site is for everything else.

- I'm building this as an exercise in DIY website architecture and templating (ie no paid products or CMS), as well as a way to divorce from the Facebook empire, see what's possible and how it feels.

- I'll keep some dogfood notes. Once there's something like a stable backbone, I'll try to publish what I'm doing on Github.

- Expect things to be unfinished and break. This is all behind the curtains.
